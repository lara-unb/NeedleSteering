NEEDLE INSERTION DEVICE

DESCRIPTION:
This subproject aims at developing a flexible needle insertion device to apply discrete insertion and rotation inputs

OBJECTIVE:
Develop a discrete insertion device based on a Raspberry Pi to actuate 4 stepper motors according to duty-cycle inputs received from serial comm

METHOD:
* Construct mechanic structure for both telescopic and discrete step insertions
* Control stepper motors to perform the correct sequence for insertion
* Obtain curvature/DC ratio 
* Calibrate and initialize the setup
* Close insertion loop from needle tip position feedback
