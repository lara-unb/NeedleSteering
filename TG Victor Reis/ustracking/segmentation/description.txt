NEEDLE SEGMENTATION

DESCRIPTION:
Algorithms for needle tip segmentation in 2D ultrasound images during out-of-plane insertion

OBJECTIVE:
Provide x and y position from segmented needle tip

METHOD:
* Pre-processing: Median filter (7px kernel) with gamma correction and gradient
* Post-processing: Watershed transform with markers 
(Distance transform -> Otsu limiarization -> region conectivity -> closing and dilation (ellipse) -> subtraction from original)
