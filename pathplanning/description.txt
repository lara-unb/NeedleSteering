STEERABLE NEEDLE PATH PLANNING

DESCRIPTION:
This subproject aims at developing a flexible needle pre- and intra-operative trajectory planner

OBJECTIVE:
Use the OMPL library to implement and test sampling-based path planning methods to flexbile needle trajetory planning

METHOD:
* Construct RRT for 2D flexible needle steering for pre-operative planning
* Construct RRT for 3D flexible needle steering for pre-operative planning
* Adapt and test other methods such as A* and etc
* Use needle tip position  feedback to intra-operative planning
