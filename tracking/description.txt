NEEDLE TRACKING SYSTEM

DESCRIPTION:
This subproject aims at developing a needle tracking system to provide the current needle position and orientation during the insertion procedure.

OBJECTIVE:
Provide closed-loop feedback from ultrasound images to an automtic needle steering system

METHOD:
* Obtain online ultrasound imagens from Ethernet connection to an Ultrasonix SonixTouch equipment
* Obtain the current transducer 3D pose from an optic tracking system (Polaris NDI)
* Detect the needle tip in "out-of-plane" ultrasound images
* Estimate the needle 3D pose from the images and the current transducer pose
